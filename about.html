			<h2 id="rockRevels">Our History and Mission</h2>
			<p class="big"><img class="alignright" src="assets/images/featured/scots_sing.jpg" alt width="400px"> Founded in
				2000, Rocky Mountain Revels is a non-profit arts organization dedicated to promoting public education,
				understanding, and appreciation of traditional music, dance, drama, and ritual through participatory theater and
				communal celebration.</p>
			<p>We have created Revels productions of Medieval, Renaissance, pan-Celtic, Victorian, Scottish, Irish Immigrants,
				and Colorado Pioneers. Each year, beginning in the late summer, nearly 100 people from all over the greater Boulder
				and Denver area come together to rehearse and create a production with full historical costumes, live traditional
				music, and authentic dance and theater.</p>
			<p>Revels productions are a unique blend of amateur and professional performers. Guest artists appearing with Rocky
				Mountain Revels have included North American step dancing champion Alexandra Siega, Native American flutist Leon
				Littlebird, folk artist David Jones, Boulder Philharmonic concertmaster Gregory Walker, and many others.</p>
			<p>There are Revels organizations in <a href="http://www.revels.org/about-us/revels-nationwide/">ten cities</a>
				throughout the United States.</p>
			<h2 id="natrevels">A Word about Revels, Our National Organization</h2>
			<p>In Cambridge Mass in 1971, <strong>John Langstaff</strong> founded Revels, Inc. to link the music, dances, and
				seasonal rituals from an older world to a modern world that needs them.</p>
			<img class="alignright" src="assets/images/featured/Jack_founder.jpg" alt width="500px">
			<p><strong>What is Revels?</strong> Revels is song. Revels is dance. Revels celebrates the seasons and cycles of
				human life through the arts, the songs and dances, and the stories from traditional cultures. Audiences recognize
				the events, desires, and dilemmas from another place and time as their own. In Cambridge, Spring Sing hails the
				renewal of life and color; SummersDay Revels glories in abundance; RiverSing marks cooler, darker days. In every
				Revels city, The Christmas Revels welcomes the return of the light.</p>
			<p><strong>Revels is community.</strong> A Revels production brings a volunteer chorus of children and adults and
				professional actors, musicians, designers, and directors into community. At each performance, this community
				invites the audience to join it. The audience always accepts the invitation, to make noises, to sing carols, to
				join hands with strangers and dance. Audience participation is the hallmark of Revels.</p>
			<p><strong>Revels is tradition.</strong> At the heart of each Revels production are the dancers, singers, and
				storytellers who preserve the arts and traditions of their own cultures. And through its respect for tradition,
				Revels has created its own. What would the holidays be without &quot;The Shortest Day,&quot; the &quot;Sussex
				Mummers Carol,&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Dance&quot;?</p>
			<p><strong>Revels is education.</strong> Revels&apos; commitment to education is the legacy of John Langstaff&apos;s
				rich and varied career as an educator. In Cambridge and some other cities, Revels offers educational programs for
				children and families, along with recordings, songbooks, lesson plans, how-to manuals, and choral arrangements of
				the music from its performances.</p>
			<p><strong>Revels is growing.</strong> The tree of Revels has deep roots, with production companies in ten cities:
				Cambridge, Massachusetts, New York City; Washington, D.C.; Hanover, New Hampshire; Oakland and Santa Barbara,
				California; Houston, Texas; Tacoma, Washington; Portland, Oregon, and Boulder, Colorado. And Revels inspires
				smaller productions across the nation. What has compelled so many to do so much for so long to help this tree grow?</p>
			<p class="lead"><strong>Revels is joy.</strong></p>

			<p class="big">Our magical Shakespearian show was a Rocky Mountain Revels original! Written by Alastair Norcross,
				Drama Director, in collaboration with Diana Norcross and Chad Boltz, Artistic Director, A Midwinter Night&apos;s
				Revels created an enchanted evening as Shakespeare&apos;s faeries and characters endeavored to save themselves from
				oblivion as the playwright, dispirited on the shortest day, resolved to burn his plays. With no fewer than 37
				characters from 17 plays represented, this was our most character driven Christmas Revels ever, with the most
				costume changes as the chorus transformed from common villagers in Stratford-Upon-Avon to Shakespeare&apos;s
				characters themselves.</p>
			<p class="big"><img class="alignright" src="2019-shakespeare-photos/2019-Revels-Musicians-best.png" width="300">We
				were pleased to have the <a title="Musicians in costume on stage, playing their instruments." href="http://boulderrenaissanceconsort.org/">Boulder
					Renaissance Consort</a> provide authentic Elizabethan music on a variety of recorders and other early wind
				instruments. Joined by Valerie Wedell, harper, a percussionist, and two trumpeters from the Flagstaff Brass, our
				musicians did an amazing job bringing the sounds of Shakespeare&apos;s world to life.</p>

				<p class="big">The Celtic myth of the merrow (half human, half fish) was featured in the tale of Coomara and the
					Soul Cages as the passengers sought to entertain themselves on a stormy voyage. The passengers and crew pulled out
					clothing and utensils on hand to create props for an impromptu Mummers&apos; Play to lighten the spirits as they
					remained at sea over the holiday. Irish dancers Emma Acker and Evan Acker joined August Plummer to amaze our
					audience with their dancing, both individually and as a perfectly coordinated trio as they cast aside their duties
					as deck hands to entertain the voyagers.</p>
				<p class="big"><img class="alignleft" src="assets/images/featured/2017_knight.png" width="25%"></p>
				<p class="big">Professional musicians Jeff Bain, Margot Krimmel, Adam Agee, Jon Sousa, and the Flagstaff Brass

				<p class="big">In addition to such sing-along favorites as âWhiskey in the Jarâ and âRocky Road to Dublinâ, our
					passengers shared more melancholy songs recalling the home left behind. Their anticipation of a new life in
					America was underscored by Emma Lazarausâ poem âThe New Colossusâ with its famous wordsâ Give me your tired, your
					poorâ and the inspiring âHymn for a New Landâ, written by George Emlen, music director of the Cambridge Revels

				<p class="big">Boarding the RMS Carpathia in 1907, a cluster of Irish emigrants gambled everything on making a new
					life in a new land. Leaving heart-broken relatives whom they will likely never see again and carrying the barest
					minimum of personal possessions, they approached the new with an excitement and ambition tempered by the loss of
					their homeland. Sorrow and joy together--the essence of what it was to be an Irish emigrant. We met new
					companions, shared a story, danced a jig, and sang together in a Christmas Ceili the whole night through; and when
					the sun rose over the New World, we saw it through the clear eyes of these indefatigable Celtic pioneers.</p>
				<p class="big">Special performers were the Celtic Steps School of Irish Dance, and Irish musicians including Jeff

				<p class="big">And what surprises they are! Leonardo has forgotten about the invitations. The haughty staff has
					neither practice nor interest in showing the proper decorum to their noble guests. And the guests are forced to
					amuse themselves with plays, dances and songs among the wonders of Leonardo&apos;s studio.</p>
